About Me</h1> </div>
        <h1 class="name">Janet Huchteman</h1>
        <p>I have worked in the <span class="highlight">oil and gas industry</span> for most of my career. As a member of the Corporate Communications department, I’ve learned a lot from my co-workers who had writing and PR backgrounds — everything from crisis communications and employee engagement to writing and editing. </p>

        <p>   I have experience with <span style="color:blue">project management</span>, including managing workload and prioritizing and communicating tasks for multiple projects across the team and other stakeholders. I’ve learned to prioritize jobs that impact the bottom line, while also managing other demands on my time. If I had a huge workload, as was usually the case, and a client wanted a quick turnaround on a project, I’d determine if the project were one that would impact the bottom line. If not, I would tell them I’d be happy to coordinate any outsourcing to make it happen, as long as they were willing to pay for it (i.e. use their budget dollars). Then, the client would either pay or wait until I could get to it. Of course, sometimes just the coordination of a job can take more time than I’d have, but this was a good practice most of the time. And more times than not, clients were willing to wait until I could work it in. They didn’t really need to have it in two days (or whatever they originally said). </p>
                <p>I’m also experienced <span style="color:blue">working with diverse cross-functional teams </span>within a company. Teams within IT, business development, human resources, investor relations and more. Each group would have its own idiosyncrasies that I learned to work with. For example, I’m very cognizant of diversity, and if I were designing annual enrollment collateral for HR or a recruiting brochure, I knew to include a diverse mix of people photos. They would want different races, ages, career paths, etc. represented in the printed pieces.</p>
